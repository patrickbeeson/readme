## Projects

These are a few highlights from Patrick's work:

**The Variable**

* Lowes Food website redesign ([homepage screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1891197/lowes_foods_homepage.png), http://www.lowesfoods.com): This project required a responsive front-end (HTML/SASS/CSS/JS) built atop the client's existing content management system. I used a mix of Bootstrap, Bourbon and jQuery to achieve a design crafted by our designers.
* DIY Trainer ([screenshots](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vpsbq5cohm33jmx/AABY_bE3v-ZQbl22yyQvRxmSa?dl=0), [project source code](https://github.com/patrickbeeson/diy-trainer)): Though no longer live, this responsive project for Lowe's Home Improvement required a full-stack build using Django, PostgreSQL, Apache and front-end frameworks Bourbon/Neat and jQuery.
* [Share the Sunshine](http://shareasunshine.com): This responsive project for Sunshine Beverages, Inc. required a full-stack build using Flask, payment-processor Stripe, and front-end frameworks Bootstrap, Compass and jQuery.

*Smaller projects:*

* Are the Dash Playing ([live website](http://arethedashplaying.com), [source code](https://github.com/patrickbeeson/arethedashplaying)): I built this simple, single-page Flask application in a couple hours to serve a basic need: Is the local minor-league baseball team playing today?
* Text Me ([source code](https://github.com/patrickbeeson/text-me)): I built this simple Flask application for a client pitch. It uses the Twilio API to catch incoming SMS messages, and send back an iPhone wallpaper customized with a person's name.
* Tinypng Compressor ([source_code](https://github.com/patrickbeeson/tinypng-compressor)): I built this Python-based command line tool to compress a directory's worth of images using TinyPNG's API.

**Virginia Tech**

* VTC Research Institute content management system ([live website](http://research.vtc.vt.edu), [source code](https://github.com/patrickbeeson/cms)): This project for the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute required a full-stack build using Django and a traditional front-end blend of HTML, CSS and JS/jQuery. This project also required integration with an existing LDAP database for authentication.
